# church_generator

A small fun-project: The main.php-script generates a PovRay-Source-File which can be rendered with PovRay.

A rendered sample output looks like this:

## Implementation details
All churches have a quite simple base-architecture with some variations: Every Church has a hall and a tower (or two symmetric ones). Length, width and height of the different parts are somewhat random.

The code itself is a horrible mess: Mixture of german and english names, zero documentation and magic numbers everywhere. But hey: It was fun :-)
